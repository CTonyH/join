  <h2>What is Join?</h2>
  <br />
  <span>
    <span class="highlight">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
    tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their
    web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term
    meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
    <span class="highlight">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
    help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
    interface. It is important to note that
    <span class="highlight">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
    and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure
    the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
    availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
    <span class="highlight">Join</span>. </span

        <h3>Exploring the board <br /></h3>
        Exploring the Board When you log in to
        <span class="highlight">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
        board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
        "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <h3>Creating Contacts <br /></h3>
        Creating Contacts In <span class="highlight">Join</span>, you can add
        contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
        added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
        the tasks on the board.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <h3>Adding Cards <br /></h3>
        Adding Cards Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding
        cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
        appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
        card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <h3>Moving Cards <br /></h3>
        Moving Cards As the task moves from one stage to another, you can
        reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
        list to another.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <h3>Deleting Cards <br /></h3>
        One a task ist completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
        delete it. Deleting a card will permantly remove it from the board.
        Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
        irreversible.
        <br /><br />Remember that using
        <span class="highlight">Join</span> effectivly requires consistent
        updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
        state of your project. <br /><br />
